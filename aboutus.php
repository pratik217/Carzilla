  <h1>About Us...</h1>
  
 

  <p>Welcome to CarZillz - India's largest auto media vehicle.</p><p> CarZilla has always striven to serve car buyers and owners in the most comprehensive and convenient way possible.</p><p> We provide a platform where car buyers and owners can research, buy, sell and come together to discuss and talk about their cars.</p>

  <b>Our Mission:</b>

  <p>Our mission is to bring joy and delight into car buying and ownership.</p>

  <p>To achieve this goal, we aim to empower Indian consumers to make informed car buying and ownership decisions with exhaustive and un-biased information on cars through our expert reviews, owner reviews, detailed specifications and comparisons. We understand that a car is by and large the second-most expensive asset a consumer associates his lifestyle with.</p>

  <b>A Brief History:</b>

  <p>CarZilla was launched in July 2012 by <b><u>Nitin</u> , <u>Shivam</u></b> and <b><u>Pratik</u></b>. Since then we have been credited with several initiatives for Indian car consumers.</p>

  <p>In 2014, we became the first website in India to consolidate used car inventory across dealers and present it to car buyers as an online marketplace.</p>


  <b>Thank you for visiting CarZilla. See you here again!</b>
